    Background
          I have over 10 years of professional experience (combined) in many worlds: sales, nonprofit administration, client care and management, development operations, wellness, and home services.

          You may have met me at a Meetup or speaking engagement-- I love to learn.

          Most recently, I am coming from a Series A startup and building & testing my basic front-end web development skills.
